", "multi_model": "Based on the context provided, the key reasons why it is important to normalize or standardize features in machine learning are:\n\n1. It ensures that all features are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of many machine learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on the magnitude of the features, such as gradient descent. This helps the optimization algorithms converge faster.\n\n2. It prevents features with larger numerical ranges from dominating the objective function and skewing the model's learning process. Standardizing the features helps ensure that no single feature dominates the objective.\n\n3. Normalization or standardization helps improve the stability and convergence of optimization algorithms like gradient descent. Without feature scaling, the algorithm may not converge properly.\n\n4. Standardizing features to have zero mean and unit variance can improve the performance of many machine learning models, as it allows the algorithms to focus on the relative importance of the features rather than their absolute magnitudes.\n\nIn summary, feature normalization or standardization is an important pre-processing step in machine learning to ensure the models learn efficiently and perform better, by putting all features on a similar numerical scale."}
